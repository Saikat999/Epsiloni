<p itemprop="description">The prices of courses on Newton are determined based on the terms of the Instructor Terms and our Promotions Policy. In some instances, the price of a course offered on the Newton website may not be the same as the price offered on our mobile or TV applications, due to mobile platform providers' pricing systems and their policies around implementing sales and promotions.</p>
<p itemprop="description">We regularly run promotions and sales for our courses, and certain courses are only available at discounted prices for a set period. The price applicable to a course will be the price at the time you complete your purchase of the course (at checkout). Any price offered for a particular course may also be different when you are logged into your AccountAccount from the price available to users who aren't registered or logged in because some of our promotions are available only to new users.</p>

No refund is due to you if you request it after the 30-day guarantee time limit has passed. However, if a course you previously purchased is disabled for legal or policy reasons, you are entitled to a refund beyond this 30-day limit.
