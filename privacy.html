<p itemprop="description">8.2. Withdrawal of consent shall be without effect to the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>
<h4 itemprop="name">9. What are the Data Protection Rules?</h4>
<p itemprop="description">9.1. The eight data protection rules (also known as the data protection principles) that apply to our organisation are that:-</p>
<p itemprop="description">9.1.1. We must process personal data fairly, lawfully and transparently. This obligation includes that we must have a valid legal basis for our processing of personal data (whether the consent of the person or that the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests (as long as these interests do not outweigh the rights of data subjects) or some other legal basis set out under the DPAs or (when applicable) the GDPR). It also means that we must be transparent with individuals about our processing of their personal data.</p>
<p itemprop="description">9.1.2. We can only collect personal data for specified, identified and legitimate purposes.</p>
<p itemprop="description">9.1.3. We can only then process the personal data that we have collected for the purposes which we have identified or for purposes that are compatible with the purposes that we have identified.</p>
<p itemprop="description">9.1.4. The personal data that we collect and the process must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes.</p>
<p itemprop="description">9.1.5. The personal data that we collect and the process must be accurate and (where necessary) kept up-to-date.</p>
<p itemprop="description">9.1.6. We must not keep personal data any longer than is necessary, bearing the purpose for which we collected it. This includes that we should keep personal data in a form which permits identification of the data subject for no longer than is necessary.</p>
<p itemprop="description">9.1.7. We must keep personal data safe and secure from unauthorised access, deletion, disclosure or other unauthorised uses. This includes not just keeping data safe and secure from persons outside our organisation, but also from people within our organisation who have no need to access or use personal data. We must also be careful when transferring personal data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”, being the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland), and make sure that we have a valid legal basis on which to transfer that data. The transfer can include using a cloud server that is located outside the EU or allowing people who are located outside the EEA access to personal data that is stored within the EEA.</p>
<p itemprop="description">9.1.8. We must comply with data subjects’ rights of information about, and (separately) access to, their personal data and with their other data protection rights, including rights to correct or erase their personal data, rights “to be forgotten”, rights to object to processing (including profiling), rights against automated decision-making and (under the GDPR) rights to data portability.</p>
<h4 itemprop="name">10. Security of your Personal Data.</h4>
<p itemprop="description">10.1. We take appropriate security measures against unlawful or unauthorised processing of personal data, and against the accidental loss of, or damage to, personal data.</p>
<p itemprop="description">10.2. We have put in place procedures and technologies to maintain the security of all personal data from the point of collection to the point of destruction. Personal data will only be transferred to a data processor if he agrees to comply with those procedures and policies, or if he puts in place adequate measures himself. In addition, we have appropriate written agreements in place with all of our data processors.</p>
<p itemprop="description">10.3. We maintain data security by protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the personal data, defined as follows:</p>
<p itemprop="description">10.3.1. Confidentiality means that only people who are authorised to use the data can access it.</p>
<p itemprop="description">10.3.2. Integrity means that personal data should be accurate and suitable for the purpose for which it is processed.</p>
<p itemprop="description">10.3.3. Availability means that authorised users should be able to access the data if they need it for authorised purposes.</p>
<p itemprop="description">10.4. We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your personal data, and to protect it against accidental loss, destruction or damage. Guru Graphics uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software networking, storage, and related technology required to run. The data you provide to us is protected using modern encryption, intrusion prevention, and account access techniques.</p>
<h4 itemprop="name">11. International Transfers.</h4>
<p itemprop="description">11.1. When we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure an adequate degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented.</p>
<p itemprop="description">11.2. We may transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en" target="_blank">Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries</a></p>
<p itemprop="description">11.3. Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en" target="_blank">Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries</a></p>
<p itemprop="description">11.4. Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/eu-us-data-transfers_en" target="_blank">EU-US Privacy Shield</a></p>
<p itemprop="description">11.5. Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>
<h4 itemprop="name">12. Will we share your information with anyone else?</h4>
<p itemprop="description">12.1. We may disclose your information to trusted third parties for the purposes set out in Section 4. We require all third parties to have appropriate technical and operational security measures in place to protect your personal data, in line with EU laws on data protection. Any such company or individual will have access to personal information needed to perform these functions but may not use it for any other purpose.</p>
<p itemprop="description">12.2. Specifically, we need to have written agreements in place with all of our data processors and, before we sign each agreement, we need to have vetted and be satisfied with the processor’s data security. The agreements also need to contain specific clauses that deal with data protection.</p>
<p itemprop="description">12.3. We use the following categories of data processors in the course of our business:</p>
<p itemprop="description">12.4. These categories may be updated from time to time and for an updated list of categories of data processors, you should check this Privacy Policy on Newton’s website.</p>
<p itemprop="description">12.5. We may pass on your details if we are under a duty to disclose or share a data subject’s personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply any contract with the data subject or other agreements; or to protect our rights, property, or safety of our employees, customers, or others. This includes reporting information about incidents (as appropriate) to the law enforcement authorities and responding to any requirements from law enforcement authorities to provide information and/or personal data to them for the purposes of them detecting, investigating and/or prosecuting offences or in connection with crime sentencing.</p>
<p itemprop="description">12.6. We may share your personal data to third parties in the event that we sell or buy any business assets, in which case we will disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets subject to the terms of this privacy policy.</p>
<p itemprop="description">12.7. We need to demonstrate accountability for our data protection obligations. This means that we must be able to show how we comply with the data protection rules and that we have in fact complied with the rules. We do this, among other ways, by our written policies and procedures, by building data protection compliance into our systems and business rules, by internally monitoring our data protection compliance and keeping it under review, and by taking action if our employees or contractors fail to follow the rules. We also have certain obligations in relation to keeping records about our data processing.</p>
<h4 itemprop="name">13. Marketing.</h4>
<p itemprop="description">13.1. We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.

The personal data transferred will be limited to that which is absolutely necessary. You will be notified in the event of any such transfer and you will be afforded an opportunity to opt-out.</p>
<h4 itemprop="name">15. Your Data Protection Rights.</h4>
<p itemprop="description">15.1. Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>

<p itemprop="description">15.1.5.
